# rpgturnbased
## Description
This 2D sample project showcases the basic mechanics and features of a turn-based RPG game. Battles consist of turns where a player can command their characters to perform various actions to defeat opponents. Characters have stat and level systems.
The project also features a saving and loading system.
## Technical details
I recommend that you download the project via git because it uses git lfs for large art files
+ Made for Unity 2021.3/LTS
